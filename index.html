            Hello, My name is Ruben Duran. I'm interested in coding for fun and for work.  Other than coding I mix and collect oldies music (2005 and before) and also collect current music from Deep House to Techno.  I am an amateur Photoshop bad artist and my stickers can be seen in bathroom stalls all over California and Texas.

            I work at a small startup that uses X-ray technology to assess bone health and body composition.  I would like to use my skills at work to help my company with their website and phone app.  I would also like to build my own phone application.
